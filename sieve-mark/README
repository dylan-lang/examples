This is the infamous rigged benchmark that shows just how fast d2c can
go. :-)

See BENCHMARK.txt for all the gruesome details.

Implementations:

  * sieve-c: Hand-written ANSI C.
  * sieve-fixed: Dylan with no bounds-checking.
  * sieve-general: Dylan with bounds-checking.
  * sieve-perl.pl: Perl.
  * sieve-python-for.py: Python, using a for loop.
  * sieve-python-while.py: Python, using a while loop.

This code won't compile unless you edit the various Makefiles (and get an
appropriate version of d2c). But it should give you a good idea of what the
final results mean.
