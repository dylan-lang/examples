DylanLibs - Net Libraries
===========================

Various libraries for accessing networks and/or the internet. Includes
various socket extensions.

1) proxy-sockets
================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Extends the Functional Developer socket implementation to work through
some firewalls. Requires a patch to the Functional Developer sockets
library which can be obtained from: 
  http://www.double.co.nz/dylan/projects/make-x-sockets.htm

2) ssl-sockets
==============
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Extends the Functional Developer socket implementation to allow using
SSL sockets. Requires a patch to the Functional Developer sockets
library which can be obtained from:
  http://www.double.co.nz/dylan/projects/make-x-sockets.htm

Also requires the OpenSSL DLL's which can be obtained from:
  http://www.double.co.nz/dylan/libraries/index.htm#ssl-sockets

3) xml-rpc
==========
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

A library providing the ability to call methods on xML-RPC
servers. Client side support only at the moment.

4) nntp
=======
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

A library that implements the NNTP network protocol.

5) lib-curl
===========

A wrapper around the Curl network library (available from
http://curl.haxx.se). It allows using protocols like http, https, ftp,
telnet and ldap from Dylan. The http-client library uses it to
retrieve web pages. It requires dylan_curl.lib, dylan_curl.dll,
libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll. These are available in the bin
directory of Dylanlibs. See the text file in that directory for
details of versions. Note that dylan_curl.lib MUST be in a directory
in the library path (as defined by the LIB environent variable) for
this project to link.

6) http-client
==============

A library that allows retreving files and/or web pages using
HTTP. Uses lib-curl to do the retrieval allowing both HTTP and
HTTPS. See the http-client-example application for an example of how
to use it.
