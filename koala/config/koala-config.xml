<!-- Koala configuration file

     This file must be placed in <koala-executable>/../config/koala-config.xml
     if you want Koala to find it.  For example, when running the koala-example
     project a copy of this file should be placed in the directory
     <koala-root>/sources/example/config/

     Anything directly inside the <koala> element in this file affects
     Koala's global environment.  Later, if virtual hosts are added, anything
     inside a <virtual-host> element will override the global environment for
     that virtual host.  Ideas for what to put in here, and sometimes how to
     name them, were stolen from Apache's httpd.conf.

<!-- LOG tells Koala what kind of log messages to display.  There are four
     possible settings, in order of importance, each of which includes the
     settings above it:
       error   - highest importance
       warning - includes errors (you can't display warnings without seeing errors too)
       info    - includes warnings and errors.  this is the default value.
       debug   - includes all log messages
       headers - show all incoming/outgoing headers.  this is so verbose it needs
                 its own level.

     A bit more granularity may be added in the future.  If the "clear"
     attribute is false then the previous setting will not be cleared
     before the new log level is added.

     The log levels should be added near the beginning so debugging statements
     emitted during config file parsing can be displayed.

<!-- SERVER-ROOT is the top of the directory tree under which the
     server's configuration and log files are kept.  Other pathnames are
     merged against this one, so if they're relative they will be
     relative to this.  The server-root pathname is relative to the
     koala executable.  NOTE: This should be near the top of the config
     file since later elements will be merged against it.

<!-- During development I usually run the koala-example project.
     Setting server-root here points it to the main koala directory.
     Once Koala runs on its own and web-apps are loaded from DLLs this
     should be changed.
