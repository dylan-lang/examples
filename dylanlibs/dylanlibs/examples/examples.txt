DylanLibs - Example Programs
============================

The projects in the examples directory are buildable programs that
demonstrate various aspects of Dylan.

1) icon-play
============
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates how to load a Win32 icon from a resource file and display
it in a DUIM application.

2) bitmap-example
=================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates how to subclass <image> to create a <win32-bitmap>
class. This class can be used to load and display bitmap images loaded
from files (rather than resources as shown by icon-play).

3) opengl-example1
==================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates how to use OpenGL inside a DUIM <pane>. Includes some
macros that could make a useful addition to an OpenGL library one day.

4) date-time-play
=================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates using the date-gadgets from the dylanlibs library.

5) simple-web-browser
=====================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

An example of a way of hosting ActiveX controls inside DUIM
applications using the Microsoft ATL DLL. This demonstration hosts the
Microsoft Web Browser component to create a very simple web browser by
creating a new DUIM gadget to host the control.

6) send-keys-play
=================
Dylan Implementations:
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates using the send-keys library by starting a DOS application
and send keystrokes to control it.

7) xml-rpc-example
