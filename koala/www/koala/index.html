      <h2>Koala HTTP Server and Template Engine</h2> Koala is an HTTP
server written in Dylan.  It includes Dylan Server Pages (DSP), a
template engine similar to JSP, without scriptlets.  But because it is
written in Dylan, and can take advantage of Dylan's powerful language
features, creating web apps in it should be much more concise and
straightforward than with JSP.

<p>The HTTP server portion of Koala was written mostly by Gail
Zacharias.  She moved on to other things before it was in a functioning
state, so I finished it up and added <a href="dsp.html">Dylan Server
Pages</a> and <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.org">XML-RPC</a>.

<p>The current version is v0.3.  It is provided mostly for the interest
and amusement of other Dylan programmers and is nowhere near production
quality.  The current version is for Windows only.  I plan to fix this
as soon as I can by porting to <a
href="http://www.gwydiondylan.org/">Gwydion Dylan</a>.  If you want to
help, let me know!

<p>There is a small demo application included, which shows how to use the
features of Koala and DSP.

<p>Any and all feedback appreciated.  Send to:
