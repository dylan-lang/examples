DylanLibs - Win32 Libraries
===========================

The projects in the win32 directory are libraries wrap or extend
native Win32 libraries (usually by providing a C-FFI based interface).

1) win32-common-controls-ex
===========================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Wraps various Win32 Common Controls functions and constants. Used by
the date-gadgets library.

2) ms-internet
==============
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Automatically generated COM wrapper for the Microsoft Internet
Explorer Web Browser ActiveX objects. Used by the simple-web-browser
example.

3) send-keys
============
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Provides methods for sending keystrokes directly to the keyboard input
queue, making it look as if those keystrokes had come from the
keyboard. Allows sending keystrokes to the currently active DOS
application. Also includes functions for screen scraping console
windows. I use this library to screen scrape legacy DOS applications.
