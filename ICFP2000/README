Language used: Dylan (Gwydion "d2c" 2.3.4pre1)

Our submission implements a Tier 1 system, with the additional
features of cubes and spotlights.

This program has been implemented entirely in portable Dylan code,
and consists of a single file ("runme").  We didn't call out to
C to do the rendering.  We didn't use an open-source package
such as POVRay for the rendering (though we could have).  We
didn't use flex for the lexical analysis (though we could have).

Most of us worked on the program using d2c on Linux or LinuxPPC.
One of us used Apple's 1995 alpha-quality "Dylan Technology
Release" (the project was cancelled during Apple's hard times)
on his Macintosh PowerBook.
