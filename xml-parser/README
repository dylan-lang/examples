This is a proof-of-concept XML parser for Dylan.

It is based on the gnome-xml DTD-validating parser written in C.
You need to install this library before you can use this one. You
can get gnome-xml, also known as libxml, from

ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/libxml/

Chances are it's already on your system if you're using GNOME, but
the version could be outdated. In case of doubt, install the latest
version from CVS.

To compile the sample application, just type 'make'. Invoke the test
program as './xml-test sample.xml'. The program should output the
names of all nodes in the DOM tree in preorder.

If you are interested to flesh this example out into a real world
library, you'd probably use the SAX interface (callback-based), and
build your own DOM tree, using a more Dylan-like object structure,
instead of messing around with the C DOM tree.

Happy hacking!
