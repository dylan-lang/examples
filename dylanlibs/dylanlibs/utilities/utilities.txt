DylanLibs - Utility Libraries
=============================

Various libraries for performing common things.

1) dynamic-library-protocol
===========================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

A library that exports a protocol allowing dynamic loading of Dylan
libraries at runtime. See the dynamic-library examples.

2) sequence-utilities
=====================
Dylan Implementations:
  Common Dylan

A series of functions for manipulating sequences, mostly inspired from
various Common Lisp libraries. Includes split-string, split-sequence,
sequence-position-if, etc.

3) money
========
A very simple implementation of a money type. Not great performance
wise but does the job for the areas that I've needed.

4) dom-builder
==============
Utilities for generating document object models which can then be
streamed as XML, HTML, etc. Provides a lispish S-Expression format
that can be used to generate the DOM in a similar manner to
AllegroServe's HTMLGEN facility.

5) dylanlibs-utilities
======================

Various utility functions, methods and macros that don't fit in
anywhere else.

6) dylanlibs-threads
====================

Routines that require thread support. Includes a <blocking-queue> and
a scheduler implementation.
