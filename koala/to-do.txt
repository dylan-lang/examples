Koala To-Do List
----------------

Version 0.4
-----------

* Gwydion Dylan compatibility.  This is hard because they don't have a 
  network library or threading yet.  But this would probably be the
  most important improvement to make since no one wants to run an HTTP
  server on Windows.  (Right?  ;-)

* URL cleanups
  - Make sure that decode-url is used in all the right places to convert
    from %xx to appropriate characters.
  - Should use 'path' in local variables to distinguish between the a URL
    (which contains a scheme etc) and just the path.


Version 0.5
-----------

* Sessions - They should be able to work without cookies enabled, either
  by URL rewriting or ...?

* New config file setting: <directory>
  <directory
     name="demo/foo"                    // required
     follow-symlinks="false"            // opt
     allow-directory-listing="false"    // opt
     default-documents="index.html,default.html"

* New config file setting: <server-administrator> (per vhost)

     

Kitchen Sink
------------

* Ability to specify a URL to be displayed when 404 errors occur.

* Search sources for "---*** TODO" and do them.

* Documentation.

* mod_dylan for Apache?

* A facility to generate .html files from .dsp files.  e.g., a way to
  flatten all the .dsp doc files into .html.

* Secure connections.  Have to finish implementing <ssl-tcp-server-socket>.

* URL cleanups:
  - Use web locators instead of strings?  Not sure it would buy much.
    Look at parse-uri and parse-request-uri, which are presently unused.
  - Have a standard API for writing a URL to the output stream so that
    it can be used to automatically include the session-id etc.

* DSP
  - More error checking at template parse time.
      - Warn when required tag call arguments are not supplied.
  - Check that tag arguments with no value (e.g., <dsp:cell nowrap>) work.
    See extract-tag-args.
  - Provide an API for clearing the output stream contents.  JSP has this
    and it could be useful for error recovery.
  - Check what exactly are the rules for using prefix= in the taglib
    directive.  What happens when two directives use the same prefix?
    When the same taglib is included twice with different prefixes?
    Does shadowing work correctly when they use the same prefix?  i.e.,
    if two taglibs have the same tag and same prefix, is the one in the
    taglib that was included last used?

* Miscellaneous
  - Replace some uses of copy-sequence with substring.  They are probably
    hold-overs from when <substring> was causing problems.
  - Use the /*exported*/ convention and the make-exports library from
    Gwydion so it's easier to keep exports up-to-date.  So far only the
    response.dylan file uses it as an experiment to see how it looked.

Gwydion notes:
  Where do they keep false-or?  In FD it's dylan:dylan-extensions:false-or
  FD doesn't handle the broken .lid file for the anaphora library.  It should
    have a file spec on the files: line.
  FD seals element on <object-table>, so <multimap> doesn't work.
  Gwydion has bogus #if #endif directives in some files, for mindy.
  
  http://www.gwydiondylan.org/gdref/gduser.html#GDUSER-WORKING-WITH-LID
  says that the Files: keyword isn't supported, but make-dylan-app
  generates this keyword and it works.
