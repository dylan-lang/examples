DylanLibs - Bin directory
=========================

Various DLL's and libraries used by some of the dylanlibs
projects. These DLL's are provided for convenience only. They are the
versions that have been tested to work with the Dylanlib projects. It
may pay to visit the original web sites of the libraries to get more
up to date versions and source code. The files are:

1) dylan_curl.lib
   dylan_curl.dll
=================

Compiled version of the Curl library obtained from
http://curl.haxx.se. The name has been changed to dylan_curl to not
affect any other Curl installation on the computer. The version of
Curl used is curl-7.9. 

The dylan_curl.lib file *MUST* be in a directory contained on the
library path, which is indicated by the LIB environment variable and
you must use the microsoft linker. The LIB variable should look
something like:

  SET LIB=d:\dylanlibs\bin

This Curl library includes SLL support and reports the OpenSSL DLL's
below.

2) libeay32.dll
   libeay32.lib
   ssleay32.dll
   slleay32.lib
===============

Compiled versions of OpenSSL v0.9.6b. They were compiled with
Microsoft Visual C++ v6.0 without using the optional assembler
modules. Original source code can be obtained from
http://www.openssl.org.

The library files aren't actually used by Dylanlibs and the DLL's are
used by the dylan_curl.dll file above.
