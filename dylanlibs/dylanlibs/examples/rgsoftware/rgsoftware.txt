DylanLibs - RG Software Examples
================================

The projects in this directory demonstrate how to use RG Softwares
NN50 DLL. This DLL allows training and using neural nets. The example
was created for RG Software to make available with their product. See
http://www.rgsoftware.com for details.

To use, Install the NN50 DLL as specified in the RG Software
website. Then you can use these projects. 

1) rgsoftware-neural-net
========================
A wrapper around the NN50 DLL. An internal module is available which
exports the C-FFI definitions. An easier to use module is also
available which hides the various FFI definitions and makes the
library more 'Dylan like'.

2) rgsoftware-dylan-example
===========================
This is the Dylan version of the RG Software VB example. It allows
selecting a file containing training data, training the neural net,
making predictions and showing input relevance. Basically it shows how
to use the rgsoftware-neural-net library.
