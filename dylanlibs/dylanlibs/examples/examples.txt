DylanLibs - Example Programs
============================

The projects in the examples directory are buildable programs that
demonstrate various aspects of Dylan.

1) icon-play
============
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates how to load a Win32 icon from a resource file and display
it in a DUIM application.

2) bitmap-example
=================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates how to subclass <image> to create a <win32-bitmap>
class. This class can be used to load and display bitmap images loaded
from files (rather than resources as shown by icon-play).

3) opengl-example1
==================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates how to use OpenGL inside a DUIM <pane>. Includes some
macros that could make a useful addition to an OpenGL library one day.

4) date-time-play
=================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates using the date-gadgets from the dylanlibs library.

5) simple-web-browser
=====================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Shows how to use the <msie-gadget> and <atl-activex-gadget> to create
a very simple web browser by hosting the Microsoft Internet Explorer
control.

6) send-keys-play
=================
Dylan Implementations:
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates using the send-keys library by starting a DOS application
and send keystrokes to control it.

7) xml-rpc-example
==================
Dylan Implementations:
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates using the xml-rpc library by calling various servers.

8) xml-rpc-interop-example
==========================
Dylan Implementations:
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates using the xml-rpc library to call an xml-rpc server that
is running the various interop tests methods.

9) base64-example
=================
Demonstrates using the double-base64 library..

10) rgsoftware
==============
Demonstrates using RG Softwares neural net DLL from Dylan. See the
rgsoftware.txt file in that directory for more details.

11) dynamic-loader
==================
Examples of using the dynamic-loader-protocol library to dynamically
load Dylan code at runtime.

12) nntp-get-message
