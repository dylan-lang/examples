DylanLibs - Example Programs
============================

The projects in the examples directory are buildable programs that
demonstrate various aspects of Dylan.

1) icon-play
============
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates how to load a Win32 icon from a resource file and display
it in a DUIM application.

2) bitmap-example
=================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates how to subclass <image> to create a <win32-bitmap>
class. This class can be used to load and display bitmap images loaded
from files (rather than resources as shown by icon-play).

3) opengl-example1
==================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates how to use OpenGL inside a DUIM <pane>. Includes some
macros that could make a useful addition to an OpenGL library one day.

4) date-time-play
=================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates using the date-gadgets from the dylanlibs library.

5) simple-web-browser
=====================
Dylan Implementations: 
  Functional Developer

Shows how to use the <msie-gadget> and <atl-activex-gadget> to create
a very simple web browser by hosting the Microsoft Internet Explorer
control.

6) send-keys-play
=================
Dylan Implementations:
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates using the send-keys library by starting a DOS application
and send keystrokes to control it.

7) xml-rpc-example
==================
Dylan Implementations:
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates using the xml-rpc library by calling various servers.

8) xml-rpc-interop-example
==========================
Dylan Implementations:
  Functional Developer

Demonstrates using the xml-rpc library to call an xml-rpc server that
is running the various interop tests methods.

9) base64-example
=================
Demonstrates using the double-base64 library..

10) rgsoftware
==============
Demonstrates using RG Softwares neural net DLL from Dylan. See the
rgsoftware.txt file in that directory for more details.

11) dynamic-loader
==================
Examples of using the dynamic-loader-protocol library to dynamically
load Dylan code at runtime.

12) nntp-get-message
====================
Example of NNTP library that retrieves a message from an NNTP server.

13) http-client-example
=======================

An example of using the http-client library. It allows sending SMS
messages to a cellphone via http://www.mtnsms.com. The DUIM window
allows entry of the mtnsms user id and password, phone number and
message. Pressing send results in the various mtnsms forms begin sent
automatically by the application. Requires the various DLL's and
librarys in the bin subdirectory of Dylanlibs to be installed.

14) http-server-example
=======================

An example of using the http-server library and the dom-builder HTML
generation functions to bring up a very simple web site, demonstrating
static HTML and forms.

15) adobe-svg-example

An example of using the <adobe-svg-gadget> to display Scalable Vector
Graphics files. The example loads the SVGAbout.svg that comes with the
Adobe SVG Control but can be changed to use any .svg file.
