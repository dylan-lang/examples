Future plans:
=============

[Not up-to-date anymore.]


  - Subroutines.

    (Try to parse an integer in the middle of a huge Meta parser...)


Wow! Most off the original problems are fixed now!  Still on the list:

  - Strings allow flexible read-ahead, but currently that's only used to 
    match substrings, which is rather boring.  It should be possible to
    make use of this feature directly.
  - Lists in addition to streams and strings.  Trivial.
  - Optimisations
